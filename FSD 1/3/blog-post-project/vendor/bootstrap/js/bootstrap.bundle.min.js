The file /blog-post-project/blog-post-project/vendor/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js is a minified version of the Bootstrap JavaScript library. Since this is a pre-built library file, I cannot generate its contents. You should download it from the official Bootstrap website or a CDN and place it in the specified directory. 

If you need help with any other file or further instructions, feel free to ask!
